![[Machine Learning.png]]
### Supervised Machine Learning
_Supervised_ machine learning is a general term for machine learning algorithms in which the ==training data includes both _feature_ values and known _label_ values.==
Supervised machine learning has 2 main sub-types, [[Regression]] and [[Classification]].
### Unsupervised machine learning
_Unsupervised_ machine learning involves training models using ==data that consists only of _feature_ values without any known labels.== Unsupervised machine learning algorithms ==determine relationships between the features of the observations in the training data.==
The most common unsupervised machine learning technique is known as [[Clustering]].
